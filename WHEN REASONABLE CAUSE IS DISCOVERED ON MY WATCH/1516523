> To help Registrants distinguish between agency and principal transactions, and to promote consistent reporting of the information required by these items, the following criteria should be used:
>
>     1. If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies the amount of the commission to be paid by the Registrant, the transaction should be considered an agency transaction and included in determining the answers to Item C.16.
>
>     2. If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies only the net amount to be paid or received by the Registrant and such net amount is equal to the market value of the security at the time of the transaction, the transaction should be considered a principal transaction and included in determining the amounts in Item C.17.
>

>     5. If a security is purchased directly from the issuer (such as a bank CD), the purchase should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17.

>     6. The value of called or maturing securities should not be counted in either agency or principal transactions and should not be included in determining the amounts shown in Item C.16 and Item C.17. This means that the acquisition of a security may be included, but it is possible that its disposition may not be included. Disposition of a repurchase agreement at its expiration date should not be included.
>
>     7. The purchase or sales of securities in transactions not described in paragraphs (1) through (6) above should be evaluated by the Fund based upon the guidelines established in those paragraphs and classified accordingly. The agents considered in Item C.16 may be persons or companies not registered under the Exchange Act as securities brokers. The persons or companies from whom the investment company purchased or to whom it sold portfolio instruments on a principal basis may be persons or entities not registered under the Exchange Act as securities dealers.

>     1.     If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies the amount of the commission to be paid by the Registrant, the transaction should be considered an agency transaction and included in determining the answers to Item C.16.
>
>     2.     If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies only the net amount to be paid or received by the Registrant and such net amount is equal to the market value of the security at the time of the transaction, the transaction should be considered a principal transaction and included in determining the amounts in Item C.17.
>
>     3.     If a security is purchased by the Registrant in an underwritten offering, the acquisition should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the underwriters are receiving from the issuer.
>
>     4.     If a security is sold by the Registrant in a tender offer, the sale should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the offeror is paying to soliciting brokers or dealers.
>
>     5.     If a security is purchased directly from the issuer (such as a bank CD), the purchase should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17.
>
>     6.     The value of called or maturing securities should not be counted in either agency or principal transactions and should not be included in determining the amounts shown in Item C.16 and Item C.17. This means that the acquisition of a security may be included, but it is possible that its disposition may not be included. Disposition of a repurchase agreement at its expiration date should not be included.
>
>     7.     The purchase or sales of securities in transactions not described in paragraphs (1) through (6) above should be evaluated by the Fund based upon the guidelines established in those paragraphs and classified accordingly. The agents considered in Item C.16 may be persons or companies not registered under the Exchange Act as securities brokers. The persons or companies from whom the investment company purchased or to whom it sold portfolio instruments on a principal basis may be persons or entities not registered under the Exchange Act as securities dealers.

> To help Registrants distinguish between agency and principal transactions, and to promote consistent reporting of the information required by these items, the following criteria should be used:
>
>     1. If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies the amount of the commission to be paid by the Registrant, the transaction should be considered an agency transaction and included in determining the answers to Item C.16.
>
>     2. If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies only the net amount to be paid or received by the Registrant and such net amount is equal to the market value of the security at the time of the transaction, the transaction should be considered a principal transaction and included in determining the amounts in Item C.17.
>
>     3. If a security is purchased by the Registrant in an underwritten offering, the acquisition should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the underwriters are receiving from the issuer.
>
>     4. If a security is sold by the Registrant in a tender offer, the sale should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the offeror is paying to soliciting brokers or dealers.
>
>     5. If a security is purchased directly from the issuer (such as a bank CD), the purchase should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17.
>
>     6. The value of called or maturing securities should not be counted in either agency or principal transactions and should not be included in determining the amounts shown in Item C.16 and Item C.17. This means that the acquisition of a security may be included, but it is possible that its disposition may not be included. Disposition of a repurchase agreement at its expiration date should not be included.
>
>     7. The purchase or sales of securities in transactions not described in paragraphs (1) through (6) above should be evaluated by the Fund based upon the guidelines established in those paragraphs and classified accordingly. The agents considered in Item C.16 may be persons or companies not registered under the Exchange Act as securities brokers. The persons or companies from whom the investment company purchased or to whom it sold portfolio instruments on a principal basis may be persons or entities not registered under the Exchange Act as securities dealers.

> Cuomo bars East Side condo developer from future sales
> New York / March 24, 2010 04:26 PM

>    
> Andrew Cuomo and the Alexander at 250 East 49th Street
>
>
>     Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has quietly settled a five-month investigation in which developer Alexander Gurevich has been banned from selling condominium and cooperative units in New York state for three years, will pay a $300,000 fine and was separately forced to offer refunds to all buyers at the Alexander condo on the East Side, The Real Deal has learned. Cuomo entered a so-called assurance of discontinuance with Gurevich Feb. 18, after launching a probe in September 2009, amid allegations that the sponsor of the building at 250 East 49th Street failed to disclose key information about the principal investors from prospective buyers. Attorney Andrew Weltchek, who represented four buyers that filed suit in federal court against the developers, said he complained to the AG about several âdefectsâ in the offering plan, leading Cuomoâs office to investigate further. âThe attorney general investigated that and figured out there were additional disclosures that had to be made,â Weltchek said. âIn the meantime, the clock ran out on the [Jan. 1] date the sponsor projected the project had to be closed.â Besides Gurevich, other investors in the property included Gene Kiselman, Eliot âEliyahuâ Spitzer[not the former governor] and Michael Steinberg. A spokesperson for the AGâs office did not have any comment on the case beyond the written agreement. Cuomo found that the buildingâs sponsor firm, 250 East Borrower, failed to disclose several key pieces of financial information in the offering plan, and the first seven amendments to the offering plan, including the following:
>
>
>     The sponsors failed to disclose that Gurevich, a practicing attorney, was a principal of 250 East Borrower and the âsole signatoryâ of the escrow agent, where buyers place their deposits when buying a new apartment. Buyers were never told that Gurevich was also the principal of Trans Continental Abstract, the title company that was recommended to buyers. They were also not told that Gurevich was the sole principal of Continental Funding, the mortgage lender recommended by the sponsor. Gurevich also owned a stake in Continental Realty, a firm that issued an opinion letter certifying the adequacy of the buildingâs common charges. Gurevich failed to sign a certification by sponsor, in which a developer swears that statements in the offering plan are true. The sponsors failed to disclose that Gene Kiselman was a principal of 250 East Borrower and he failed to sign a certification by sponsor. Gurevich and Kiselman did not return calls for comment, despite promising to do so. Steinberg and Spitzer were not immediately available for comment. Lawyers for the sponsor were not immediately available for comment. The AG settlement says the agreement indicated that the sponsors must continue to fulfill their obligations at their existing condos at 2523 Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn, 4102 13th Avenue in Brooklyn and 802 Avenue U in Brooklyn. According to the settlement, all escrow funds have either been returned to buyers or transferred to the account of DâAgostino, Levine, Landesman & Lederman. A new amendment, released Feb. 18, says that Peter Silverman, a founding partner of Silverman Schlar Shin & Byrne, is being appointed sole manager of the sponsor, replacing Gurevich. The date of the anticipated first closing was changed to March 1, 2010, however it is unclear whether any units have closed. A new rescission offer will be made if the first unit closing is delayed 12 months for buyers who purchase apartments after the Feb. 18 amendment.

>     1.     If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies the amount of the commission to be paid by the Registrant, the transaction should be considered an agency transaction and included in determining the answers to Item C.16.
>
>     2.     If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies only the net amount to be paid or received by the Registrant and such net amount is equal to the market value of the security at the time of the transaction, the transaction should be considered a principal transaction and included in determining the amounts in Item C.17.
>
>     3.     If a security is purchased by the Registrant in an underwritten offering, the acquisition should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the underwriters are receiving from the issuer.
>
>     4.     If a security is sold by the Registrant in a tender offer, the sale should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the offeror is paying to soliciting brokers or dealers.
>
>     5.     If a security is purchased directly from the issuer (such as a bank CD), the purchase should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17.
>
>     6.     The value of called or maturing securities should not be counted in either agency or principal transactions and should not be included in determining the amounts shown in Item C.16 and Item C.17. This means that the acquisition of a security may be included, but it is possible that its disposition may not be included. Disposition of a repurchase agreement at its expiration date should not be included.
>
>     7.     The purchase or sales of securities in transactions not described in paragraphs (1) through (6) above should be evaluated by the Fund based upon the guidelines established in those paragraphs and classified accordingly. The agents considered in Item C.16 may be persons or companies not registered under the Exchange Act as securities brokers. The persons or companies from whom the investment company purchased or to whom it sold portfolio instruments on a principal basis may be persons or entities not registered under the Exchange Act as securities dealers.

>
>     2. If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies only the net amount to be paid or received by the Registrant and such net amount is equal to the market value of the security at the time of the transaction, the transaction should be considered a principal transaction and included in determining the amounts in Item C.17.
>
>     3. If a security is purchased by the Registrant in an underwritten offering, the acquisition should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the underwriters are receiving from the issuer.
>
>     4. If a security is sold by the Registrant in a tender offer, the sale should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the offeror is paying to soliciting brokers or dealers.
>
>     5. If a security is purchased directly from the issuer (such as a bank CD), the purchase should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17.
>
>     6. The value of called or maturing securities should not be counted in either agency or principal transactions and should not be included in determining the amounts shown in Item C.16 and Item C.17. This means that the acquisition of a security may be included, but it is possible that its disposition may not be included. Disposition of a repurchase agreement at its expiration date should not be included.

The purchase or sales of securities in transactions not described in paragraphs (1) through (6) above should be evaluated by the Fund based upon the guidelines established in those paragraphs and classified accordingly. The agents considered in Item C.16 may be persons or companies not registered under the Exchange Act as securities brokers.

> Andrew Cuomo and the Alexander at 250 East 49th Street
>
>
>     Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has quietly settled a five-month investigation in which developer Alexander Gurevich has been banned from selling condominium and cooperative units in New York state for three years, will pay a $300,000 fine and was separately forced to offer refunds to all buyers at the Alexander condo on the East Side, The Real Deal has learned. Cuomo entered a so-called assurance of discontinuance with Gurevich Feb. 18, after launching a probe in September 2009, amid allegations that the sponsor of the building at 250 East 49th Street failed to disclose key information about the principal investors from prospective buyers. Attorney Andrew Weltchek, who represented four buyers that filed suit in federal court against the developers, said he complained to the AG about several âdefectsâ in the offering plan, leading Cuomoâs office to investigate further. âThe attorney general investigated that and figured out there were additional disclosures that had to be made,â Weltchek said. âIn the meantime, the clock ran out on the [Jan. 1] date the sponsor projected the project had to be closed.â Besides Gurevich, other investors in the property included Gene Kiselman, Eliot âEliyahuâ Spitzer[not the former governor] and Michael Steinberg. A spokesperson for the AGâs office did not have any comment on the case beyond the written agreement. Cuomo found that the buildingâs sponsor firm, 250 East Borrower, failed to disclose several key pieces of financial information in the offering plan, and the first seven amendments to the offering plan, including the following:
>
>
>     The sponsors failed to disclose that Gurevich, a practicing attorney, was a principal of 250 East Borrower and the âsole signatoryâ of the escrow agent, where buyers place their deposits when buying a new apartment. Buyers were never told that Gurevich was also the principal of Trans Continental Abstract, the title company that was recommended to buyers. They were also not told that Gurevich was the sole principal of Continental Funding, the mortgage lender recommended by the sponsor. Gurevich also owned a stake in Continental Realty, a firm that issued an opinion letter certifying the adequacy of the buildingâs common charges. Gurevich failed to sign a certification by sponsor, in which a developer swears that statements in the offering plan are true. The sponsors failed to disclose that Gene Kiselman was a principal of 250 East Borrower and he failed to sign a certification by sponsor. Gurevich and Kiselman did not return calls for comment, despite promising to do so. Steinberg and Spitzer were not immediately available for comment. Lawyers for the sponsor were not immediately available for comment. The AG settlement says the agreement indicated that the sponsors must continue to fulfill their obligations at their existing condos at 2523 Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn, 4102 13th Avenue in Brooklyn and 802 Avenue U in Brooklyn. According to the settlement, all escrow funds have either been returned to buyers or transferred to the account of DâAgostino, Levine, Landesman & Lederman. A new amendment, released Feb. 18, says that Peter Silverman, a founding partner of Silverman Schlar Shin & Byrne, is being appointed sole manager of the sponsor, replacing Gurevich. The date of the anticipated first closing was changed to March 1, 2010, however it is unclear whether any units have closed. A new rescission offer will be made if the first unit closing is delayed 12 months for buyers who purchase apartments after the Feb. 18 amendment.
